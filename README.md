# static_site_generator

## FUNCTIONS

This program will take an *input_path* and *output_path* (defined in first two lines of main.py) and convert any nested markdown files to html files and output to the defined *output path*. Additionally, images and css styling to be included in the generated pages should be placed into the **static** folder. I have left the test content in the directories for future testiing, but if someone else should want to use the program as is, just delete the contents from the **content** folder and the **static** folder.
